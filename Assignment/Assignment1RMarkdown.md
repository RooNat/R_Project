## Wave plot

Define a vector called x consisting of a sequence which starts at 0 and goes to 20 in increments of 0.01. You can do this using the `seq()` function.

```{r cars}
x<-seq(0,20,0.01)
x
```

Next create a vector called `y`, which is of the same length as `x`, such that the $i^{th}$ entry of `y` is equal to the sin function of the $i^{th}$ entry of `x`. This can be done via the R function `sin()`.

```r
y<-sin(x)
y
```

Then create a data frame called `sin_df` with two columns: `x` and `y`. 
You can inspect the first few rows of your data frame with the `head()` function like this: #Rnote (`head()`)
```r
sin_df<-data.frame(x,y)
head(sin_df,3)
```

â€¢ Write a statement to plot sin df.You can do this using the `plot()` function. This aims to display a plot with $x$ as the `x-axis` and $y$ as the `y-axis`.

```r
plot(sin_df)
```
