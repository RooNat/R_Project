## Wave plot

Define a vector called x consisting of a sequence which starts at 0 and goes to 20 in increments of 0.01. You can do this using the seq() function.

```{r cars}
x<-seq(0,20,0.01)
x
```

Next create a vector called y, which is of the same length as x, such that the i
th entry of y is equal to the sin function of the ith entry of x. This can be done via the R function sin().

```{r}
y<-sin(x)
y
```

Then create a data frame called sin df with two columns: x and y. You can inspect the first few rows of your data frame with the head() function like this:

```{r}
sin_df<-data.frame(x,y)
head(sin_df,3)
```

â€¢ Write a statement to plot sin df.You can do this using the plot() function. This aims to display a plot with x as the x-axis and y as the y-axis.

```{r}
plot(sin_df)
```
